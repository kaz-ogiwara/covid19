The decrease in the number of PCR tested cases on March 19 was due to exclusion of Chiba prefecture, which had been reporting the number of tests instead of tested cases. Initially, only pseudosymptomatic surveillance (a survey of patients with suspicious symptoms) was reported as the number of PCR tests, but from March 4, tests on people who were in close contact with suspected carriers were included, so only data from March 4 onwards are shown on this page. <a class="more">READ MORE</a></p>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <section>
            <h4>Q. Why are the numbers of cases PCR tested negative or largely increasing?</h4>
            <p>A. Because there have been adjustments in case of corrections or additions of the report from each prefecture. For example, on March 19 and 25, the numbers of people PCR tested were minus, because Chiba and Osaka prefectures, respectively, corrected their reports (they had been reporting the number of PCR tests instead of that of people PCR tested). Also, the total number of people PCR tested would be large when MHLW added report of a prefecture which had not been reporting their number. Usually, in such cases, the past numbers should be corrected because it is a change of definition, but MHLW just corrects only the latest number in order to, perhaps, make the daily publication in time.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Q. Can I see the number of PCR tests on this page?</h4>
            <p>A. No. This page (currently) shows only the number of PCR tested cases. The PCR test may be performed multiple times for one person. It will be counted as 1 tested case. Therefore, in many cases, the number of PCR tests is larger than that of tested cases.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Q. Why is the number of people PCR tested soaring since March 4?</h4>
            <p>A. This is because the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare have expanded the range to be included in the published figures. The number of tests itself has not increased. Specifically, in addition to the symptom-based surveillance, tests for close contacts have been included in the published numbers. Usually, numbers with different standards should be handled in separate frames, but it is impossible to distinguish between the two because the announced numbers are overwritten. If we make a graph as it is, the number of inspections will appear to have increased sharply, so on this page the color of the graph is changed, and the reason for the increase in the note is added.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Q. What is the difference between the number of infected people and the number of patients?</h4>
            <p>A. "Infected person" refers to a person infected with the new coronavirus = a person who has tested positive by PCR. Except for those who have no symptoms (= asymptomatic pathogen carriers), those who actually have symptoms are called "patients". It is the same notation as the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Since the PCR test also targets close contacts of known infected people, there are cases in which "there are no symptoms but actually infected", and the number of infected people and the number of patients are not equal.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Q. Why are the data different from the press and announcements from prefectures?</h4>
            <p>A. It depends on the individual case, but it seems to be due to the difference from the MHLW standards. The MHLW receives reports from each prefecture and finally summarizes data nationwide by eliminating duplication. In the process, aggregation criteria, for example, regions, may differ. Another possibility is that the number of patients is confused with the number of infected people.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Q. How can I access data sources?</h4>
            <p>A. For example, here is the data as of March 9, 12:00. <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/index.html" target="_blank">厚生労働省</a> [Japanese] - <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/" target="_blank">English site</a> - <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/newpage_00032.html" target="_blank">Latest information on Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is HERE.</a></p>

          <section>
            <h4>Q. Can I use data and source code on my SNS or blog?</h4>
            <p>A. Feel free to use it for both commercial and non-commercial use. The specific standards are based on the MIT license. You don't have to ask for permission, but it's good to have a follow-up report, so contacting us will help us because we can easily tell the company "Let's keep publishing."</p>
